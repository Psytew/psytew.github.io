        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2025</p>

        <p>Digital Bouquet ("we", "us", or "our") operates mobile applications. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our apps.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our apps are designed to collect minimal data necessary for functionality.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our apps may use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These services have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
